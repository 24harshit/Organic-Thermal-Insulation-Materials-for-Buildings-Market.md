 Organic-Thermal-Insulation-Materials-for-Buildings-Market.md
Organic thermal insulation materials are lightweight, high-density materials used for building insulation. These materials are primarily derived from organic compounds, such as polystyrene and polyurethane foams. They provide excellent thermal insulation but also come with certain limitations, such as poor aging resistance, high flammability, and significant environmental concerns. Despite these drawbacks, they remain a preferred choice in residential and commercial construction due to their superior thermal efficiency and ease of installation.
